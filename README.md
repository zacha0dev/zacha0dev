Hi, I'm Zach, and I'm fully vested into the life of technology. There's not much that I don't enjoy, so long it peaks my brain. 

Right now I work with Azure Networking and support their range of products, from connectivity services, application protection services, application delivery services, to network monitoring. 

I plan to continue to develop my skills to go into Cloud Architecture and eventually start to develop applications with an entrepreneurship goal behind them.
