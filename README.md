Hey, I'm Zach, and I'm really into technology. I enjoy almost everything related to it, as long as it challenges my mind.

Currently, I work with Azure Networking and help with various products like connectivity services, application protection, application delivery, and network monitoring.

My future plans involve advancing my skills in Cloud Architecture and eventually creating applications with an entrepreneurial mindset. I want to start my own business with these applications.
